2.  Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
    - `git clone https://github.com/afizsavage/javascript-capstone`
3.  Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:
    - `javascript-capstone`
    - `ls -la`
4.  run `npm install` on the command line to download all dependency packages.

### Run
